    <p class="dear"> My Beautiful Alex, </p>
    <p> whose eyes comfort my soul...   
        <br>
        <br>
        I guess I’ve been a fool to believe that I would mean
        enough to someone as special as you to hold your
        attention. I guess we run in different circles you and I,
        and our circles are concentric versus overlapping. It is a
        miracle that we found a tangent and came together at
        any point. But I’m sure somewhere down the road I’ll
        find someone to who cherishes me as much as I do
        them. You need someone handsome, bold and dynamic;
        someone who can be there for you when you need
        them. Someone to watch over you.
        <br>

        I used to think your ex was crazy to let you go. Now I
        understand what happened to him. He ignored the many
        warning signs you gave him and chose to stay on the
        emotional roller coaster you presented. I wonder how
        many times you told him you were leaving and then
        relented so that he came to believe that it was just talk –
        until you left.
        <br> 
        <br>
        One thing that has finally become clear: whereas I
        had envisioned you in my future, you don’t see me in
        yours. So I guess you figure it’s time for you to move on.
        Perhaps it’s time for me to move on as well.
        <br>
