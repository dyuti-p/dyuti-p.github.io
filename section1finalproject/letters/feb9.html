    <p> I remember it like yesterday. I had a boyfriend
        and you had a girlfriend. However, we decided to be
        friends. Then one magical day, we both were single.
        Thus, we decided to date one another. I must take a
        moment to admit that our relationship was great.
        <br>
        <br>
        We made mad passionate love two or three times,
        we talked on the phone all ends of the night, we
        supported each other in extracurricular activities, and
        we went to a variety of events together. But just like all
        good things our relationship had to come to an end. I do
        not know why it ended maybe it was the distance in our
        schools, maybe you wanted someone else, or maybe I
        wanted someone else.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Five long years has passed away and I thought that I
        had forgotten about you. Until, today when I saw you
        walking your new girlfriend across campus. This picture
        made me jealous and angry. I wanted to be that girl,
        again. I wanted you for my man, again. I wanted to be in
        your arms, again. Now she has you and I am not mad at
        her. I am only mad at the fact that I might still love you
        or want you in my life. But, I must let the past be put
        behind me. All I want is to let you go.
        <br> 
        <br>
        So now I am going to work on gain strength to
        continue on and forget about you. One day I will have
        the man of my dreams and now I know that he is not
        you. I just needed to let you go and breath out and
        exhale in. Exhale you out of my life for one last time.
        Inhale a new future with a bright light ahead in.
