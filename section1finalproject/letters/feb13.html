    <p class="dear"> Noah, </p>
    <p> I’m writing this not to send to you but because
        I don’t feel like I have anyone else to talk to. Lauren and
        Andrea are so tired of me talking about you and the
        situation, if there is actually a situation anymore I
        suppose it depends on how you look at it, I don’t even
        think they listen to me anymore. Maybe I’m just beating
        a dead horse and none of this really matters anymore.
        Maybe I’m lonely and that’s why I keep writing, whatever
        it is I wish it would just go away. I wish I could just get
        over you and move on and be okay with where I am and
        where you are and what we were and how we ended.
        But that doesn’t seem to be happening now or any time
        soon.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s been nearly four months since we officially broke
        up; it’s been two since we’ve slept together. But this isn’t
        about the sex, god knows I miss it but that’s not what it’s
        about even though I’m sure you think it is. I miss you as
        a person. Not just the person who loved me and held
        and made me feel better about myself, but also as a
        person to just talk to and hang out with. I miss a lot of
        things. I miss the random gifts, and the big hugs you
        used to give me ‘cause you never wanted to let go. The
        soft kisses, and amazing sex. I miss the two o’clock
        conversations and lying under the stars. I miss not
        having to talk; we were comfortable just to lay their in
        silence. I miss that level of comfort more than anything. I
        miss going to movies and having someone’s hand to
        hold and having someone who would listen to me
        babble on endlessly about whatever stupid thing I was
        excited about that day. I miss having someone excited
        to see me, I miss having someone love me, and I miss
        having someone to love. I miss criticizing your music,
        and rolling my eyes at your corny jokes. I miss listening
        to you play the piano, I miss having someone know me
        insides in out. I could close up and not say a word and
        you would know what was wrong, I could lie and say
        something completely different and you would see right
        through it. I miss having someone know everything and
        understand, I miss touching your nose and kissing your
        back, I miss how we could never really fight, although
        we never failed to try. We didn’t even fight when you found out I cheated on you, or the second time. We
        didn’t even fight when we broke up, we just cried.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Maybe we knew it wasn’t over. Maybe we knew that
        this was going to be an ongoing process. I think it was
        probably the fact that we didn’t break up because we
        didn’t love each other anymore, ‘cause I did love you
        and I know that you loved me. That could be the
        problem here; maybe that’s why I can’t move on. I can’t
        seem to get over the fact that there’s really no reason
        that we broke up other than the fact that I just wanted
        freedom. Freedom to go out, to fuck around with whom I
        please, freedom to be the selfish bitch that I am. And I’m
        sorry that I used you and I’m sorry that you got pulled
        into a situation like this one, you never deserved any of
        this. You never deserved to be hurt like you were. You
        never really deserved any of this, and I never really
        deserved you.
        <br>
        <br>
        I keep saying to myself, well maybe we’ll run into
        each other next year and this will all be different, maybe
        then it will be okay, maybe then we can be together. It’s
        an illusion. I’m not the same person I was when we
        were together, and I’m sure that you’re not either,
        college has changed me and I’m sure that it’s changed
        you. And next year when you’re really in college when
        you move down here and you’re on you own it’s gonna
        be completely different. All the lack of self esteem is
        gonna go straight out the window, ‘cause I know that
        you’re gonna do well. You’re a good looking guy and
        you’ve got a loving caring personality, girls are gonna be
        all over you. And even if we were to run into each other
        next year I don’t think you’d give me a second glance.
        You’ll eventually hate me, and by the time the year is up
        I’m sure that day will have come. You’re gonna want
        nothing to do with me. And I accept that, I know that’s
        what I deserve.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to ask you to drop off my book while I’m home.
        But I don’t know if I can. I’m not supposed to be talking
        to you period. And the last time you were here, when
        you came because you’re a great guy and you were
        concerned about me. You said that that was goodbye
        again that that was it again we weren’t gonna be seeing
        each other again. Of course it seems with us there’s
        always one more time. You told me that all my pictures
        were put away, that all memories of us were put away,
        you don’t talk about me anymore, you probably try not to
        think about me anymore. It’s hard to know that you’ve
        shut me out of your life entirely. I just want to make a
        request to see you again, but its selfish request, and I’m
        sure it’s not fair to you. I’ll probably go ahead and
        request it anyways, ‘cause that’s who I am; I’m selfish. I
        don’t want to be, but I’m sure I will anyways. I just wish
        you knew that how truly sorry I am, I know you say you know. I know that you know I’m sorry, I don’t think you
        understand how sorry. I don’t you understand to what
        degree I hate myself for all of this. I can’t stand that I let
        go of something so good. I hate myself. But there’s
        nothing for me to do about it anymore. It’s over with and
        you’re done.
        <br>
        <br>
        I just wanted to let you know I sill love you and I’m
        sorry.
