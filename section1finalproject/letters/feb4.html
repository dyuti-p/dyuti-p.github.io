    <p class="dear"> A, </p>
    <p> I don’t know what it is about us. I feel
        desperate today and I have no idea why. I want to cry
        and can’t understand that either. I dreamt of you last
        night and didn’t want to wake up. I feel like it is another
        “Ok Here we go again”. Only this time it isn’t exactly the
        same. I am no longer the troubled girl who relies on you
        for safety and you are no longer the needy boy clinging
        to me for acceptance. I have no idea how you feel, and
        why it is always me saying what I feel.
        <br>
        <br>
        Maybe you are trying to play a game with me. To see
        how far you can take me before I break. If I really told
        you what I felt right now would it make a bit of
        difference? It hasn’t before, but I still want to know. So I
        am going to tell you again how I feel in words you’ll
        never read. The first letter was an apology this one is
        taking it back.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I hate you right now. Not only because you used
        words to make me believe that we were still friends, but
        because you lied to me and cheated on her. We aren’t
        friends anymore because the friend I knew wouldn’t
        have done that. I tried to think we still could be, but
        friends don’t sleep with each other then make the other
        one feel like shit the day after. I expected so much more
        than what I actually got. Maybe that was me being
        sappy, but I don’t want to make excuses for you. When I
        tried to talk to you about what happened, it seemed like
        you were laughing that I felt bad, like you had a score to
        settle. Now I guess I know what you felt like all those
        times I did it to you. It still doesn’t excuse it. I mean,
        think about how you felt, painful as it may seem, and
        ask your self what you have to prove by making
        someone else feel like that. But as you have written, no
        one can change the past we can only move forward.
        Also, you and I will never be “WE” ever again.
        <br>

        The chapter is over and the book has been closed.
        We seem to be holding out hope that one of us will still
        be around. I read your lyrics and I wonder if you still feel
        that way about me. But then I realize, that is exactly
        what they are songs. Do you think of me when you sing
        them while she looks up at you? Well, I am walking away. I should have the day you left a message on my
        voicemail after 2 years of not talking. Why feel the need
        to bother me now? I didn’t mean that much to you while
        you were dating Bridget. Or did it bother me that we
        didn’t talk? To tell you the truth I hadn’t even thought of
        you until that fateful day. We were best friends and I
        suppressed those feelings and stopped talking to you to
        get through my own personal crisis.
        <br>
        <br>       
        Then you call and all the feelings I had for you came
        back in one instance at the sound of your voice. I was
        excited to see you after 2 yrs. Now I wish I never
        returned the call. If you wanted to hurt me you have
        succeeded. What happened to not hurting me anymore
        and being “Fair”? It isn’t as hard for me to tell you my
        feelings anymore but apparently it is for you. Why are
        you so afraid? I know it hurt you before, but you need to
        understand I am not that person anymore. I can handle
        things good or bad. If you love me, I would tell you I love
        you too.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why make me feel this way then forget all about me?
        How could you do this to me? Did you just want me to
        say I love you so you could move on? I am sorry I never
        told you before and why I figured that it would matter
        that I said it now makes absolutely no sense to me. I
        guess I thought because of what we had before, I would
        still matter and it would make you happy. I was wrong. I
        haven’t been able to go one day without thinking about
        you since Christmas. Distance isn’t that big of a deal
        when you really think about it and what I need to realize
        is that you’re not the same guy and you’ve changed. I
        made you this closed hearted person you are. I feel
        terrible for it. I know you have a girlfriend and I hope you
        don’t treat her bad because I treated you bad. That
        wasn’t how it was supposed to be. If I had given you half
        the chance you deserved, I wouldn’t be here writing this
        letter to you. But I am not the only one to blame. You
        write about love and being in love, but do you really
        know how? I never was able to show you I loved you
        because I didn’t love myself. You deserved so much
        better just as I deserve better now
        <br>
        <br>
        I have changed. I have grown up. Love is a big thing
        for me. I don’t say it loosely and if I do, I mean it. It isn’t
        something you say just to sleep with someone. I used to
        use sex as an excuse for love because I thought it
        would make my boyfriends happy. All it got me was a
        drug habit, and a bad case of depression. I should have
        known you would use me. In the end that was all we did
        was use each other. So I can’t really be mad about that.
        I just hoped you would have respected me a little more.
        I guess I just hoped this time would be different, but I
        never thought I would get brushed off like I have. I had a
        lot of hope holding out for us, and now it is all gone. You’ll be the love of some ones life someday; I really do
        wish it could have been mine. But I have to walk away
        because we don’t feel the same. I just feel regret, and
        hate and I don’t need to spiral down again.
