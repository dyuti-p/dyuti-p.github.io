    <p class="dear"> You </p>
    <p> I feel really lost again like my heart is trapped
        behind bars. I can't love, I can't feel. I think I'm just hurt
        so bad I am so afraid for it to happen again. I don't even
        want to risk it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't care if they say those who do not take
        chances don't really live. Well, they never added a
        couple little extras to that. They may not live but their
        hearts are whole their minds are careless, and their
        outlooks are more positive. I know if I trust my heart with
        someone else I'll be back on the floor picking up the
        pieces and my knees are already bruised from the last
        time I had to.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I know I said before I wouldn't let you hurt me too
        badly and my tears were reserved for the deserving but
        now I think no one is ever going to see my pain. I don't
        think I can take it now I just want to live and have fun
        and not have to wonder if my heart is still in your hands,
        or if you set it aside when I'm home alone. I want the
        phone to ring with people I like to talk to and with plans
        to go places. Not defending myself against your harsh
        words and putting up with your friends. I don't need
        that....I don't deserve that.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        You made me feel like I'd be nothing without you
        which I saw past and the leading on you did well....I
        might as well have had a leash on.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I just need to learn how to feel again because as of
        now I'm numb.
