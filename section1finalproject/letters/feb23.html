    <p class="dear"> Dear Amira, </p>
    <p>    
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes when I'm laying in my room
        reading, I can hear you singing through the wall. I
        always put down my book and close my eyes and just
        listen, because you have a way of making any song,
        any ordinary song, extraordinary. There are angels in
        your voice, and there are instruments that I can't even
        imagine, but I can hear them when you sing. But I also
        know that like most beautiful things, there is sadness in
        your song.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        You talk about driving away, just leaving for some
        unknown destination in search of less hurt, more
        harmony, more anything but what you are going through
        now. Amira, I wish I knew how to make things better for
        you. The truth is, I don't know anything to say or do to fix
        things, and although I can say "its going to get better",
        thats just speculation. Because I don't know.
        <br> 
        <br>
        But I do know this:
        You bring light to my life. You are a diary and a
        singalong and a much needed laugh. You have so much
        talent in your mind and heart and body and it is
        impossible for you to contain it inside, though you often
        doubt it is there. But I can see it so clearly. And I know
        that when you sing, you create the harmony that you are
        craving in your life. I can hear it so crisply, and I wish
        with all my heart that you could hear the beautiful
        sounds you create.
        <br> 
        <br>
        So if you ever feel the need to get in to a car and
        drive after your happiness, I just ask that you take me
        with you. Because I will never, ever know another like
        you.
