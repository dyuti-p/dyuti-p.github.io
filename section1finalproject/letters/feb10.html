    <p class="dear"> Matthew </p>
    <p> Lissa called me the other day. She said that
        when she was introducing Drew to you that she couldn't
        think of anything to call you except to call you my ex.
        And we both got a laugh out of it since its been such a
        long time since you were my boyfriend. But I guess you
        will always be my ex-boyfriend. No matter how much
        time goes by.
        <br>
        <br>
        I still hate you, even after all of this time. I'm not sure
        why; I thought that when I got over you I'd get over
        everything- but the way you treated me still haunts me
        in the back of my mind and every time I am about to
        start a new relationship all of those feelings of pain,
        anger, and loneliness come floating back to memory. I
        don't think I ever hated anyone until you. There were
        people that I didn't like too well, but I was able to
        tolerate anyone. I guess that is why I was able to stay in
        our relationship for so long. Perhaps I hate you so much
        because I loved you so much and you took it all for
        granted. I feel as if you have scarred me for life. But I
        don't want you to have that kind of power over me. I
        don't want your face to come up between me and every
        new guy that I meet. I want this all to be over. I want to
        forget you and leave you in the past completely.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I just met this great guy the other day Matt. I haven't
        dated for months now. I can never seem to bring myself
        to commit to anyone anymore and get scared after the
        third date and never call them again. But this time I want
        to be able to give myself wholly to him like I gave myself
        to you. I don't want to be scared to do that. Things are
        going really well with him, and I'm very excited for it. Do
        you know what surprised me about him? Is that he
        doesn't care if I look nice even when he doesn't get to
        see me for much time on that day. Things like that
        shouldn't be surprising but they are. He doesn't care
        that I work in a office with five men. And he doesn't get
        jealous when I hang out with my little brother. It's sad
        that all of these things bothered you. But that is your
        problem. What is really sad is that I let them still bother
        me.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Did you know that I was ashamed to hug my brother
        in front of you after that day you complained? My little
        brother. It wasn't fair that because of you I cheated him
        out of my love. It wasn't fair to him to be dragged into
        that at all. And because of you I stopped talking to my
        older brother; one of my closest friends. Just because
        you didn't like the way he joked with you.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I think everyone would be surprised to find out who
        you really are. I know that I was. On the outside you are
        the Homecoming King every year, the ASB president
        and the top varsity player of all the sports you entered.
        Everyone admired you for your confidence; but you
        don't have any. And you took mine away. You are so
        empty and lonely on the inside. You get upset with
        anything that you can't control. But I put up with every
        bit of it. Because I loved you. I thought that if I could be
        the best girlfriend ever to you that you would finally start
        treating me well. But there is no way anyone can be the
        girlfriend you want them to be. You were so afraid that I
        would cheat on you that I lost all of my good guy friends,
        when ironically it turned out; you were the one cheating
        on me.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I remember the first time you called me "bitch" and
        how upset I got. You apologized over and over and said
        you would never do it again. But then it became a daily
        occurrence. And all of my empty threats to break up with
        you were just that; empty. I lived with you cussing me
        out because you had brought my self-esteem so low
        that I couldn't picture myself surviving without you.
        Oddly, it was my self esteem that first attracted you to
        me. Is it a game for you to rip it away from someone?
        Did you think that if you took mine that you would gain
        some?
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I hoped that after I broke up with you all of the hurt
        would go away. I would stop crying at night and stop
        living in constant fear of making you angry. I don't think
        there was a day in the last eight months of our
        relationship that we didn't have at least one argument.
        But none of it went away when I told you it was over;
        because you wouldn't leave me alone.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I honestly don't know what would have happened that
        night you had me pinned against the door of my
        apartment if my brother-in-law hadn't pulled up right
        then. All I remember is that I was kicking you as hard as
        I could and it wasn't phasing you a bit. After that I
        started seeing your car following me around town; and
        you showing up at my work. I lived in constant fear of
        you. The night I found you waiting outside the store next
        to my car I lost it and called your dad. He was always
        close to me. I threatened that I'd get a restraining order
        on you unless he kept you away from me. I hated to do that to him. I know that it upset him. But I was seriously
        scared of what you might do to me.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        After that whole "stalking phase" I heard that your
        parents forced you to get anger management
        counseling. I'm glad. All I ever wanted was for you to be
        happy. And since I wasn't able to make you that; maybe
        a counselor could. But my life was still in shambles. Do
        you know that I broke up with a guy, the sweetest guy I
        have ever met, because I couldn't handle him being nice
        to me all of the time? I think I got used to the fighting
        and making up. I didn't know how to have a relationship
        without that.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        You made me into such an awful person. I was
        always so angry and bitter with you. When I think of you
        I still wish that I could slap your face. Just keep slapping
        until all of this anger has finally released itself. But I
        know that's not the answer. I know that you probably
        never even think of me anymore. Which isn't fair since
        you still rise in my relationships. I don't want to get my
        heart broken again like you did to me. I don't think I
        could take that another time. But its been about a year
        and a half now since all of this. I've moved across the
        country, I have a new job and a new phone number and
        I know that you will never find me. I am slowly piecing
        my life back together. And I am slowly restoring my
        belief in relationships.

        <br> 
        I'm ready to leave my anger and hate behind, Matt.
        You'll just become another faceless memory of a boy I
        once dated. I wish you the best in your life and your
        future. And maybe one day you'll meet a girl who you
        will treat like a queen. For your sake I hope you do. I
        hope you do find love and happiness and get all of the
        things you ever dreamed of. Because I did love you; you
        were my first and always will hold that spot. But those
        are my last wishes for you. I'm not going to let you come
        into my thoughts anymore. And I'm not going to live in
        fear of relationships anymore. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm finally leaving you behind,
        </p>
