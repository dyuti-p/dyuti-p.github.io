    <p class="dear"> Dear Karen, </p>
    <p> I've waited far too long to say this.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I first met you, it was in a women's bible study
        class at our church. You stood out from the crowd in
        there because you were straightforward and honest with
        your feelings; some people labeled you as, "not being all
        there upstairs", but you seemed ok to me, looking pretty
        darn good for someone who was 40. You acted like and
        had the personality of a twenty-something.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Anyway, I recall the study leader saying something like, "Karen, tell us how you introduce people to Jesus." 
        <br>
        <br>
        And you said, "I just grab 'em by the throat and say,
        "Jesus loves you, man!!"
        <br>
        <br>
        I knew you were kidding, but the funniest thing was
        that some of the elderly ladies in there didn't think you
        were, and that was the charm of it. It was hysterical.
        <br>
        <br>
        Over time you'd call my house to see how my
        husband and I were, or wish us a Happy Birthday or a
        Merry Christmas, only I didn't see the calls like that.
        <br>
        <br>
        I saw the calls as annoying and repetitive. I wasn't
        much of a phone conversationalist, and I remember
        many times I'd let the machine pick up, and mutter,
        "Geez, I just spoke to you the other day, I don't have
        anything to talk about!" To the extreme, I even saw the
        calls as an attempt to "pick up" on my husband. But I
        didn't have a thing to fear; you were just being friendly
        and harmless as a baby hamster. You were only trying
        to show compassion and caring in the way you knew
        how. Why didn't I see that?
        <br>
        <br>
        You always ran up to me in church, genuinely happy
        to see me, and ready with a hug. You always had a
        compliment about something I was wearing, and you'd
        proudly show off something you found from the Goodwill
        at a bargain price. "Look! I got this sweater for THREE
        bucks!"
        <br>
        <br>
        Remember when my husband was diagnosed with
        Hodgkin's Lymphoma and had all that chemotherapy and radiation? We had to sit way up in the balcony at
        church because the doctor said for him not to get too
        close to anyone, because of his weakened immune
        system. You were so eager to see us after we'd been
        out for so long in the hospital. You came bounding up,
        ready to give us both hugs. But again, I saw it as an
        annoyance. I even remember what I said.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Stay back. If he catches any of your germs, he'll get
        sicker."
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, granted, a cancer situation makes a person act
        in different ways towards different things. I was under a
        lot of stress, and playing the part of "protective mother
        hen." But I could have expressed that a lot more
        tactfully, you know? I was pretty darn rude. And all you
        wanted to do was care.
        <br>
        <br>
        Time passed and I didn't see you at church very
        much. I spoke to you about 3 weeks ago and THIS time,
        I made up my mind to treat you better than I had been.
        When I invited you over to dinner at my place, you were
        so excited, like a kid in a toy store.
        <br>
        <br>
        Last Sunday I didn't see you at church, but when I
        thumbed casually through the church bulletin, I knew
        why
        <br>
        <br>
        You died on me, Karen.
        <br>
        <br>
        You died and were buried earlier that week, and I
        didn't even know until that day. I sat there in the pew,
        absolutely sick and numb. I wept a great deal through
        the service.
        <br>
        <br>
        There's so much I would have gone back and done
        over, Karen. I would have treated you so much better;
        but my stupid pride was in the way. Where the hell is my
        pride now, Karen? What difference does it make? Some
        Christian I was. Now you're gone and standing in the
        presence of God, glorified and the way He meant for
        you to be. No one can ever say again that you are, "not
        all there upstairs" because you're a perfect being now.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to say I am so sorry for the way I treated you
        while you were here. I'm crushed that I never was able
        to keep the promise to have you over for dinner. No
        more hugs, no more tales of the Goodwill store and no
        more cheery phone calls. I am such a fool for taking you
        for granted. I prayed so much for a friend in my life, and
        you were standing in front of my blinded eyes the entire
        time. I was so stupid.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned a very hard lesson in all of this, Karen. I
        have learned to truly reach out to people and genuinely
        care about their welfare, because they may not be here
        tomorrow. That sounds like such a glib statement, but it really takes on new meaning, especially when one goes
        through it for real. It is a shame that it takes the death of
        a soul to learn that lesson, but God will do whatever
        works best in a person's life. Part of your very purpose
        on earth might have been to change that part of my
        heart. Well, it worked. I just wished you didn't have to
        die for it to happen.
        <br>
        <br>
        Good bye, Karen. I sure could use one of those hugs
        of yours right now.
        <br>
