    <p class="dear"> The ones that meant something, </p>
    <p>    I never thought it was possible to miss a time
        period so much. Last year, I thought I had it so bad, I
        thought I was misunderstood... that no one knew what I
        was thinking or feeling. I got to the point that I would
        drink and fool around with my boyfriend because I didn't
        think anything else would help. God, was I wrong. I look
        back on it now and I think "wow, I really liked that guy" "
        damn, that girl was so cool." I secluded myself to my
        small group of friends, and now they have all moved or
        broken away.
        <br>
        <br>
        The new school is great, don't get me wrong. I love it,
        most of the time... but that little bit that I don't I miss
        YOU ALL so much it hurts. The boy that got away, it was
        fun chasing you. The girl that always thought she had to
        be tough, your beautiful... I envy you. The girl that I used
        to know so well, I am sorry we grew apart. The boy that
        always made me laugh, thank you.. I miss you.
        Everyone at my lunch table, I miss the routine stupid
        conversations and silly notes. The boy that got me
        through the year, I hope your happy now, I miss you the
        most. To the boy that broke my heart, thank you, you
        taught me so much. So many people that I could add to
        this list.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I have had a total change of mind-set this year, I have
        become quieter, more subdued. I have become so self
        conscious its getting ridiculous, I am sketchy about
        everyone that I know, I cant seen to completely trust
        anyone anymore. I've lost the confidence that I used to
        pride myself on, I've lost my ability to go up to anyone
        and start a conversation, or do something just for the
        sake of being weird. I feel like I have misplaced my
        identity and I don't have the heart to search for it
        anymore.
        <br> 
        <br>
        When I was with you guys, I knew my place. I knew
        my friends, I knew how everyone was.. and usually what
        they were thinking or doing. I knew who would be
        where, what I would be doing that weekend and what
        was going on. Now, I don't, I am like this little lost girl in
        a big room full of strangers, never knowing where to turn or who to turn to. I grow close to someone and then they
        do something that makes me reconsider my views.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I guess I am just hoping I will find my place soon, and
        will stop feeling so lost without all of you, and maybe
        hoping you didn't forget me already...because I know I
        didn't forget you.
