    <p class="dear"> Dear Mallory, </p>
    <p>    I hate you. It’s childish and selfish, but I hate
        you. I hate that you were such a big part of his life for so
        long. That you were the one he turned to when he was
        hurting. I hate that you still talk to him. And that he finds
        comfort in the memories of your past. I hate the fact that
        I will never be as good. I will never equal what the two of
        you had. I will never live up to the standards you have
        set for him when he looks for someone new.
        <br>
        <br>
        But you two are over. And now there is me. He might
        never look at me the way he did you, but I can always
        hope. Because maybe he'll look at me a different way. A
        better way. The thing is though, I always get this small
        flicker of hope and then you re-enter the scene.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        You are constantly emailing him. You are constantly
        messaging him on AOL. You confess your love for him
        in your online diary. Did you know I was aware of all of
        this? I don't think he knows, I don't want him to. But I’m
        keeping tabs on you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        You had your turn with him, 14 months at that. But
        now it's over. And god damnit it's my turn now. It’s my
        turn to experience his wonderful charm. It’s my turn to
        be showered with his kisses. It’s my turn to fall head
        over heels in love. It’s my turn to be the one he calls out
        for. It’s my turn to be all he needs. It’s my turn to be his
        baby.
        <br> 
        <br>
        You had yours. And now it's mine.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Don't try to change his mind anymore. It won't work. I
        won't let you win this. My feelings for him are so much
        stronger than you think. And I’m not going to give up
        that easily. I’m finally ready to fall in love. And he is the
        person I want to fall in love with. Don’t try to take him
        away from me a third time. I know you've tried twice
        before. But you failed. And you will again. Don’t you get
        that?
        <br> 
        <br>
        He told me he was falling in love with me. He told me
        he missed me when I was gone. He told me I was the
        one he wanted to be with. So what is the problem? What don't you understand? It is me now. Not you. I am
        sorry you don't understand, but it really isn't that difficult.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Please stop trying to win him back. Because you
        won't. You can't. It simply isn't going to happen. So save
        yourself the energy of trying.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I hate you. Plain and simple. I always will. And I know
        you hate me too. But that doesn't matter. I am his
        girlfriend now. And you are finally out of the picture. So
        do us all a favor and stay away for good this time. It will
        make things so much easier for all of us.
