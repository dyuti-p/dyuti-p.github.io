    <p class="dear"> Paulo, </p>
    <p> I remember when you first IM'ed me, I was a
        little bit nervous and even afraid of responding. But in a
        matter of time we began to chat regularly. And then we
        talked on the phone. I learned alot from that first
        conversation about you. We got along really well and it
        was refreshing to talk to someone that actually could
        express themselves so clearly. We kept on talking for
        weeks on and off. You wanted to me to visit you and I
        said I would. But as the day neared I avoided your
        phone calls. I'm embarrassed to admit that I did that.
        <br>
        <br>
        I thought you'd forgotten about me, I'd already filed
        you to my memory. Although I hardly had anyhthing to
        remember. I remember when I saw your picture I
        thought you were gorgeous. Two beautiful eyes stared
        right back at me. I felt intimidated by you. I can't believe
        that I am telling you this. It's true I felt intimidated by you
        and it prevented me from visiting you.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        When you IMed me many months later, I was
        surprised, then I was shocked and then I felt a little
        embarrassed. You asked why I hadn't gone and I said
        because I got scared. I think you may have thought that
        I was scared of what you would be like. But the truth is
        that I was scared. I am more afraid of that than anything
        else. You see Paulo, I have learned to not let a person
        into my vulnerable place. i don't trust with my heart and I
        don't ever stop doubting myself. I know you hate
        insecurity and I am working on fixing that. I may come
        off to you as if I am very aware of what I am worth but I
        am not. So I put up a front of being so "up here" but in
        reality, I am so afraid.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every tantrum I throw is calculated to infinite detail, I
        analyze and dissect every word carefully. I tell you my
        thoughts and my feelings, But I have never told you the
        reasons or my deep worries. So now it's a few months
        away before you come back home and I am going to be
        there when you get here. I am scared again, I am
        nervous again. But now I know that regardless of
        whether or not you accept or reject me I am so much
        more of a person than I was months ago. But it's a risk
        that I would like to take. Because the difference between me then and me now, is that this time I *know* that I
        have nothing to lose and only everything to gain. I will see you soon.
