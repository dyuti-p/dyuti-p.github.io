    <p> February 16, 2003 </p>
        <br>
    <p class="dear"> Dear Mom and Dad, </p>
    <p>  I'm not sure that I can ever forgive you for what
        you did to our family. Did you think you were doing a
        good deed by finding the most disturbed kid in foster
        care and bringing her into OUR home, making her a part
        of OUR family? Most kids have 9 months to get used to
        the idea of a new baby, but we had only 6 to get used to
        the idea of an 11-year-old version of Rosemary's baby.
        This is not fair, especially since you had been planning
        the adoption for more than two years before you told us.
        Helen has brought so much pain and suffering into our
        house that our family will never been the same again. If
        I could go back in time and prevent you from adopting
        her, I would do it in a second.  
        <br>
        <br>
        I still don't understand why you did this. What was
        missing from our family that you needed to bring in from
        elsewhere? Why can't you see that Helen is a cruel,
        heartless, and angry person? She doesn't love us, and
        she isn't thankful for what you've given to her, and she
        doesn't deserve to be a part of this family. She isn't
        capable of forming relationships, even her social worker
        told you that. Even after two years she doesn't call you
        'mom and dad', she doesn't hug or kiss you, and she
        doesn't turn to you for guidance or support. Why do you
        still shower her with love and affection? I don't
        understand how you could favor your adoptive daughter
        over your REAL daughters. You spend so much time
        with Helen that you neglect us. It isn't fair.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I know what you're thinking--that I'm selfish. I'm only
        trying to protect Jenny and Kate. Remember them?
        They're your real daughters, the ones who need you the
        most right now. Helen HURTS them, physically and
        emotionally. Helen is abusing us just like she was
        abused, but you're too in denial to see it.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Do you need proof? The other day Helen bit Jenny
        on her arm. Helen is THIRTEEN years old, and Helen is
        only eight. When Jenny started to cry, Helen hit her
        across the face, knocking her over- and it even left a
        bruise by her temple. You dismissed it when I told you
        what happened, even though Jenny was bleeding and bruised. And that's only one incident out of hundreds.
        Jenny doesn't trust you to take care of her anymore.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Helen can't hurt Kate and I because we're bigger
        than her, but that doesn't stop her from cursing at us
        and insulting us. We try to ignore her when this
        happens, but then she smacks Jenny around or gets
        revenge some other way. It was Helen's fault that Kate's
        hamster is dead. Helen let the animal out of its cage and
        shut it in the same room as the dog. She laughed at the
        struggle that took place inside the room. She only thing
        stopping me from slapping her is the wrath I would face
        from you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        When I confront you about Helen's behavior, you only
        say that "she acts the way an abused child acts." You
        can't possibly think that her behavior is due entirely to
        the abuse she suffered. I think she is just a rotten
        human being, without any feelings of remorse or
        empathy. I can easily see her growing up to be a
        psychopath and ending up in jail.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I hate you for spending thousands of dollars on
        Helen's medication and therapy, while I'm searching for
        scholarships and financial aid. I hate you for exhausting
        your resources on Helen. I'm going to college next year,
        then Kate, and eventually Jenny. Helen is 13, Jenny is
        8, and they both read at the 4th grade level. Helen will
        be lucky if she ever gets her high school diploma or
        goes to Community College- and I don't think she has
        enough drive to get herself there anyway.
        <br> 
        <br>
        You tell me that the therapy that you are getting for
        Helen is helping her, but I can't believe it. Nothing can
        help her. She brags about how she lies to her therapist.
        She lies to you too. She manipulates you. We'll be lucky
        if Jenny doesn't end up with "reactive attachment
        disorder" like Helen. She could get the disorder just from
        having to live with Helen and suffering your neglect.
        <br> 
        <br>
        This is what I've wanted to say throughout this whole
        letter: You have ruined our family. It's too late to fix
        anything. Oh how I wish we could send her back. She
        has sucked all the joy out of our home. I'm afraid of what
        will happen to Jenny when Kate and I are both at
        college.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I am graduating in June, and I am saying goodbye to
        you and this life which has been a nightmare for the
        past two years. I just hope I can continue to protect Kate
        and Jenny from the brutal intruder you welcomed into
        our house.
