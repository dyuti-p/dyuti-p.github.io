    <p class="dear"> Stanley, </p>
    <p>    I'm not in love with you Stanley; so don't get
        nervous, you poor cagey darling. I only really find you
        tempting every now and again, when you're not being
        completely self-serving, or completely unavailable. But
        then, I confess I have these other moments, time warps
        through unresolved issues.
        <br>
        <br>
        I know I once told you I'd had a crush on you in
        middle school, but I'm sure I never told you how my
        daily existence was validated by a flash of a smile in my
        direction, or a slight chuckle at one of my crude jokes. I
        have so many vivid memories of middle school, some to
        do with pre-adolescent social agony on a larger scale…
        but most of the instantly recallable sensations have to
        do with you, and the way the room began to whirl a little,
        the way my throat would seize and my veins would
        throb with intoxication, from just a whiff of your cloying
        scent.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        There's a particularly visceral snapshot in my mind's
        photo album, of that day in ninth grade. You were over
        at my house, we were sitting on my bed, and we had
        stopped talking…I remember, because my senses were
        singing, I remember I was running my hands through
        your hair; your long hair, parted down the middle. I tease
        you about it still, every once in a while; it made you look
        like Rider Strong on Boy Meets World. (I distinctly recall
        thinking on the first day of sixth grade that the new guy
        was disappointingly unattractive. But that was before
        you started oozing your belligerent charisma all over the
        place. And before you grew up. A little.) That day, in my
        all Laura Ashley room, I remember you telling me you
        liked it when girls wove their fingers through your hair. I
        don't remember taking the hint. And even though you
        sometimes let slip that we came close to being together,
        I think your sixth grade torture, now outweighed by
        years of friendship, is too imbedded in my engineering
        for me to believe that you ever have found me at all
        appealing. But why should that be of any consequence?
        <br> 
        <br>
        Even in recent years, there are moments that snare
        me: the way a certain t-shirt will stretch languidly across
        your broad frame, the look of enigmatic intelligence and thoughtfulness your reading glasses imbue you with.
        Grace, before dinner at your family's house, sometimes
        surprises me with the astonishing softness and vital
        warmth of your hands. I've always loved your hands,
        your musician's hands. You have such long fingers.
        They've always struck me as awkward and elegant at
        the same time; they exude a rough deftness that's so
        compelling.
        <br> 
        <br>
        But the real reason I stick around is your writing. It's
        indescribably beautiful, and inexplicably addictive. It's so
        un-elaborative, so unlike mine, so taut with passionate
        tension; it's like a melody you heard only once that
        continues to haunt you in moments of loneliness. Much
        like my memories of you sometimes give me
        goosebumps. I think on some level I stay by you to be
        close at hand when your talent fully blossoms; I want to
        witness your release into public consciousness, and to
        claim a friend's rights, maybe even a dedication page.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Your talent keeps you irresistible…even as my days
        are frequently validated by greater things than you,
        greater things than me.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I'm a happier, healthier person than I've ever been, I
        feel increasingly comfortable with myself and in my
        body. Sometimes I'm even buoyed by purpose. But,
        within the confines of our relationship, I still sometimes
        feel like I'm in grade school. The only reason the subject
        of this letter is of any concern is because I may forever
        assume that I am unattractive to the majority of the
        world, even if I might very well be, and though I usually
        don't care, much. And all because somewhere in my
        past is a dangling participle (pun intended.)
        <br> 
        <br>
        I watch myself crumble in the wake of your writings,
        and I am intrigued; given hindsight and perspective, how
        can I still have these concerns, entirely separate even
        from how I feel about you as a person, that go back to
        before I had braces? You've seen me too; I finished
        reading 'Flirt' and slipped off to the bathroom. When you
        asked later what was wrong, I calmly and objectively
        explained as best I could…That your poignant detail,
        your smooth prose, makes a girl feel like all she'd ever
        want out of life would be for someone to write about her
        that way. And then I started crying again, much to my
        continued surprise. You left, despite the hour, to write a
        letter. Who was that letter destined for, Stanley? Will I
        ever know? Will you ever have anything exposing, or at
        least consoling, to say?
        <br> 
        <br>
        I sometimes imagine that on my twenty first birthday,
        I will finally say something. 'Be a good friend, a
        supportive, caring friend for once…help a girl out with
        something that's bothered her for years; a decade, to be
        exact…Please Stanley, could I just kiss you? We'll still be friends…Or…could you maybe write about me?
        Think of it as tying up a lose thread in one of your
        stories…' But then, I suppose that's not your style; to
        give yourself away.
