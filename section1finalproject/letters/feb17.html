    <p> February 17, 2003 </p>
        <br>
    <p class="dear"> Dear Jen, </p>
    <p> You waited so long for me to put a letter here,
        and, since I know that you read it, I wasn't ever going to
        do it. Why bother? You don't read my words for what
        they are, and even if you did, I've learned to face the
        fact that it wouldn't change a thing. I can't make you
        love me, as much as I wanted to. As hard as I tried.    
        <br>
        <br>
        But you use everything against me. Everything that I
        showed you; everything that I've told you. You use your
        journal to trash me, even though I didn't do anything
        wrong. I loved you, even when you told me you'd
        NEVER LOVE ME. I sat beside you through thick and
        thin, even when you told me to leave. You treated me
        like DIRT and you only admit it to make yourself happy
        because then it fills your holy conquest to find a reason
        to kill yourself. I can't even tell you how bad you hurt me
        or make you understand because if I did, if I tried to,
        you'd just throw it in my face and say that I never loved
        you, completely ignoring that all my pain STEMS from
        how much I DO LOVE YOU. How you feel about
        Michelle; how you'll never love another? Yeah, I feel
        you. What she did to you, you did to me. I wonder if you
        even recognize that....
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Tears stream down my face; tears you can't feel.
        Tears you don't believe. Frustration courses through my
        veins; frustration that you never even gave me a chance
        in your heart. Frustration at how you take everything out
        on me. Frustration at how you say you love me, say you
        don't, say you did, say you never did; frustration at how I
        know the truth. I've never felt so helpless and small in
        my life. The only thing I've ever done good; the only
        thing I've ever put my all into, and all I have to show is
        this vast and painful hole torn right from the middle of
        me. WHY CAN'T YOU FUCKING HEAR ME?! Why
        doesn't it make a difference?
        <br> 
        <br>
        Remember that book you gave me? The one you
        brought back from Florida as a gift? In the days past,
        I've turned it into something quite extrodinary. A flower
        on every page. A flower from my soul; a flower cut
        straight from my veins. A flower for the rose you forgot
        at my house. A flower for the way you used my art to pick up chicks. A flower for telling me you loved me,
        then taking it back. A flower for never giving me credit.
        And I know it doesn't hurt you. And I know it doesn't
        matter. Your so keen on seeing me again; maybe it'll
        matter to you then. How you affected me; ME! Someone
        who begged you not to cut and hurt yourself. Someone
        so TOGETHER when you first met me. Last night,
        thinking about you, I took a lighter and burned an x
        across my heart. A bullseye. Now I'm sitting here,
        getting drunk, wishing someone would do some target
        practice. If only you were here; we know you're a dead
        shot.
        <br> 
        <br>
        One day you'll regret it. I keep telling myself that. One
        day you'll remember how bad Michelle was to you and
        you'll remember how I waited on you hand and foot and
        worshipped you. As the years go by and you skip from
        bad relationship to bad relationship, succombing to
        everyone who will hurt you, casting aside those who
        truly love you, you'll one day wake up and realize that I
        was a catch. I have to tell myself this to keep myself
        from completely losing it and giving up on life altogether.
        Something so good, so right, can't be so easily
        forgotten. That, and that one day, I'll wake up and I'll
        remember how good Katt was to me, or Lou was to me,
        and I'll be able to love someone besides you again.
