    <p class="dear"> To the one who will never know, </p>
    <p>    My heart is full of emotions for you, and there
        are moments when it feels as though it will explode, and
        yet I can never find the right way to say this. I'm hoping
        that this time it will come out right, or at least close to
        what i really want to say. This is about the tenth time
        that I've sat here trying to write you this letter, trying to
        unwrap my heart and let you see inside of me,
        something I wish I could do face to face.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are times when I question the way I feel for
        you, which would be almost all the time and probably
        due to my state of continual confusion. Confusion about
        my life, who my friends are, who you are. I barely know
        you, so why do you have this affect on me? Why does it
        feel as though someone hit the pause button on my
        heart whenever I hear you name? Why do I want to hear
        your voice on the other end when the phone rings? This
        is probably some childish infatuation, a little crush right?
        I tell myself that often. I tell myself that I'll just forget
        about you and move on, but the more I talk to you, is the
        deeper I fall for you.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I don't want to be hurt, I know how it feels. Everyday
        when I come home and look at my life I'm hurt, when I
        see my mother crying because of things my father says
        I'm hurt and although I know that I don't need more pain
        and that feeling whatever it is I feel for you may very
        well lead there, I still want to be with you. But I know
        what I need and although I want you, I'll try and forget
        what we might have had.
