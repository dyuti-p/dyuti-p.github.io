    <p> February 25, 2003 </p>

    <p class="dear"> Mike, </p>
    <p>    It's been a long 5 months and I just want it
        over with. Yes. I want it over with. Completely over with.
        I dont want to wake up thinking about you, go to bed
        thinking about you or go through the day thinking about
        you. I don't want to wish anymore and kill myself with
        the endless what if's and I don't want to know what you
        even think anymore. I don't want to hear or know your
        reasons but to say "I don't want to know you" is a little
        extreme.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s been complete hell. Trying to get over you is and
        has been the hardest thing I’ve had to do, pathetic as it
        seems. Over and over I've asked myself why are you
        doing this? You'd think after crying as much as I did, I'd
        just get on with it, move on with my life and not wish for
        someone who made me so miserable. Yes, I may have
        ruined things by crying and fighting with you but if it
        weren’t for the fact you seemed to forget me over night
        things wouldn’t have been like that. All the promises
        broken.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Disappointed isn’t the word. It doesn’t come close to
        explain the feeling I get when I think of you. Never did I
        think the one person who I loved so much would hurt
        me so much. I've spent countless nights wasting them
        just wondering what I did wrong and why you were
        doing this. But I don’t want to anymore. I've done all I
        could. I tried to make you see we had something
        worthwhile. But right now that’s something you just don’t
        want to see, and maybe one day you'll regret that. I
        made myself completely vulnerable to you. Gave you
        every last inch. It makes me almost sick to think how I
        acted. Running as soon as you called. Thinking things
        might actually change. Yes I was happy for the night you
        acknowledged my existence, until the next morning
        when it was right back to your friends and it just began
        all over again.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I told you I would try to understand... and I did as
        hard as I can, and I'm sorry if you didn’t think that was
        enough. But I will never understand how you could just
        throw what we had away. I guess I have to accept it and
        move on with my life. You obviously wasted no time. How you could sit and look me in the eye and just lie to
        me, only to make me feel like a complete ASSHOLE
        when I found out is something I'll never forget.
        Sometimes it’s all I can think of when I look at you. As
        hard as I try I can’t push that thought away. Maybe it’s
        because I have to see her everyday. It almost makes me
        see you as a different person through in all the times
        you made me cry and feel worse than shit and it does.
        So your feelings have changed. I understand that. Ever
        think you might have told me that when they first did,
        don’t you think it would have made this a hell of a lot
        easier? You wouldn’t have to deal with me crying and I
        wouldn’t be holding on to the little bit of hope I had left.
        <br> 
        <br>
        And yes, you’ll take my phone calls and answer me
        online... almost as if you have to. And you’ll talk to me,
        but its nothing of substance. It’s as if you never knew
        me, and as much as it hurts to say, I don’t think it puts
        much of a dent in your life anymore.
        <br> 
        <br>
        So why am I writing this letter? To just get it out. To
        say I’m done. I’m done hoping you'll come back to me.
        I’m tired of trying to show you how much I love you. It’s
        something you just can’t be bothered with. One day I'll
        figure out why this all happened. There’s a reason
        behind everything. But you don’t know the affect you've
        had on me. You broke my heart. More than once. And I
        wish I just knew why. I can’t keep hoping you'll come
        back to me, because you're not.... and you're not even
        the person I used to know. You know, we always said
        we'd talk and be in each others life, and I wish we could
        be friends, and I don’t know what’s in the way of that.
        <br> 
        <br>
        It’s your call now, you know how I feel. Sad part is, if
        you called me today you know I'd be there for you in a
        second. That’s my problem though... but it doesn’t look
        like you'll be calling anytime soon.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I wish you would just open your eyes Mike and see
        what's in front of you.
    </p>

            I still love you, <br> Erin </p>
