    <p class="dear"> Marissa, </p>
    <p>    sa,
        I'm sitting here compiling a CD. One with
        thoughts of you. I wish I could give you a copy, as a way
        of saying good bye, but also hello. To let go of what
        could have been, and smile at the thought of what was.
        To build a life long friendship with a kindred spirit,
        because though we are different in many ways,
        nonetheless we are the same. I think when it all comes
        out, you and I want the same things out of life. To be
        happy, to feel as if we have wings and can fly anywhere
        with the sun in our face and it doesn't burn. Or to fly
        swiftly through the night with the stars reflection in our
        eyes and the smile we have on our face is true, not
        forced. To feel unconditional love and an honesty within
        ourselves that we know exactly who we are. Yes, maybe
        I'm sort of naive to feel this way, but when it's all said
        and done I think we are the same. Maybe just not for
        each other.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I say good bye I want to say that you will always
        have a place in my heart saved for you to crawl into
        should you ever question if you are loved. I want to tell
        you Marissa, that even though I wasn’t what you
        wanted, I'm thankful that you have given me the chance
        to share with you the time we had. It was amazing. I
        know that there were some times that were so hard for
        you and you did your best and you know that’s
        cherished within me. I will always hold you dear. There
        is a journey for you and I hope to see you at the end of
        your path. I know that I have my own path to take ,and
        your face in my memories will be a great treasure to
        look back on for strength and a reason to better myself.
        I have learned that just because someone doesn’t love
        you the way you want them too, doesn’t mean they
        didn’t love you with all they had...and I did love you.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I never knew I had it in me, and I have you to thank
        for that. And at first I thought there was no way I could
        be without you. In becoming your friend I'll know now
        what it's like to miss someone in a way unimaginable, to
        be sitting right next to you and know I can't have you.
        But I'll be damned if you're not a part of my life. You
        mean too much and hopefully I mean the same to you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        And I say hello to a new uncharted adventure with
        you. I say hello to new found memories and laughter. I
        say hello to letting you in my new ideas and dreams, to
        hopefully sharing many thoughts and many tears, and
        your shoulder to lean on. Though you may never know
        what my heart has held for you, I will say this. Thank
        you for giving me the smiles that brought me to life. Just
        your smile, never frown, pixie, because you never know
        who is falling in love with your smile. Just as I did.
