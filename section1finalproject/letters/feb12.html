    <p class="dear"> To that part of myself- </p>
    <p> Forgive me in advance. I am preparing to drag
        you through the mud, and I feel it is only fair that I warn
        you. You see, heart, there is this boy..and yes, I do know
        that is how most of your issues with me thus far have
        started. He just got out of a relationship with a woman
        he loved. A woman he'd been with for two years. And
        though the both of us know that this is a very dangerous
        situation, we continue to maintain our friendship.
        <br>
        <br>
        We claim that, at least. That we're only friends. But it
        doesn't feel that way when he's hugging me. And it
        definitely doesn't feel that way when he's making love to
        me. And I'm a friend, right? So I shouldn't feel that knife
        when he talks about his ex; when he talks about how
        much that particular wound still stings. There is
        something about him that I can't get away
        from...something in his voice that plays over and over
        again in my head while I'm trying to sleep. And you were
        there that time he didn't call for a whole day. This is not
        good. I want to be mad at him, heart... because he
        knows how I feel, and he knows that this isn't going to
        end up good. But he gets close and he whispers things
        in my ear.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        He tells me that he's going to be careful with me, and
        that we're both very intelligent people. That we
        communicate well. We should be able to maintain a
        healthy relationship. Right? Wrong. So very, very wrong.
        Oh, heart..I'm sorry. This isn't going to feel good. But I
        can't seem to get away from it. You see, I'm so attracted
        to his mind.. and who he is as a person.. that I try to
        shut my ears off when we reiterate that we're 'just
        friends'. I'm sure it'll work out in the end though,
        because you know that it is, in fact, the scars that make
        a heart beautiful. I'm sorry in advance. </p>
