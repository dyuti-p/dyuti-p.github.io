    <p class="dear"> Wayne, </p>
    <p>    I never saw you coming. I never would have
        expected to feel so strongly for you. At first it was new
        and we were exploring what we had discovered and I
        had all my walls up so that you could only get in so far.
        Then, somewhere between then and now, the walls
        disappeared and I let myself once again feel. I couldn’t
        get enough of you. I couldn’t taste your lips hard
        enough, I couldn’t be alone with you long enough. You
        felt the same as I did, you told me so. You never
        expected to feel like you do with me and I sure as hell
        didn’t fit the profile you had in mind and neither did you,
        but it was there. So we escaped. We took evenings off
        early and went to what became our place. Talking and
        laughing and just absorbing each others company. I was
        ready to do whatever you wanted me to do, I wanted to
        be whatever it was you wanted me to be. Then, one day,
        you changed. You drew back and didn’t want to feel
        anything with me anymore. I waited for you, I waited for
        you to decide what it was you were debating. I waited
        months for you...nothing. Finally, I couldn’t stand it any
        longer. I couldn’t stand acting like nothing ever
        happened between us and that I didn’t feel anything for
        you. I waited too long for you. I waited too long for
        someone the least likely to come along and fit so
        perfectly.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was tired of hearing about you and your girlfriend
        and I made sure to mention whom the latest it was
        sharing my bed. I was tired of the looks and the
        whispers behind our backs at work. It was forbidden, it
        didn’t make sense and it didn’t change the beating of my
        heart. Even when I have been with someone else, they
        just didn’t compare to the way I felt when I am with you.
        So, I would rather be alone for the right reasons than to
        be with someone for the wrong.
        <br> 
        <br>    
        So after the company Christmas party, while I was
        intoxicated, by a few mixed drinks and by your smile, I
        went to your house. I cooked you dinner and I found
        myself once again waiting. We started goofing around,
        and I kissed you and you kissed me back. I led the way
        into your bedroom, I was ready to for you. You all of a sudden stopped and gave into reason. We couldn’t be
        together. You had 101 reasons why. All of which I heard
        and all of which had everything to do with you and
        nothing to do with me, except for the smoking, you said
        you would never be with someone who smoked. You
        fool, I would give up all my bad habits for you. I would
        give up everything I had for love. I believe in it. I believe
        in you. I told you I was in love with you and cried and
        explained everything that I had been carrying around
        inside me for nearly a year. You had nothing to say,
        nothing but that you could not listen to this now, you
        could not listen to what I had to say to you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Here we are, still friends, and I am still in love with
        you and still waiting. I am waiting for you to realize that
        the best relationships are not founded on common
        sense and reason, those are the building blocks for
        compromise. Don’t you see? Don’t you see that I would
        never try to change you? That I love you for all that you
        are, all that you have been and all you have yet to be? I
        do not know what will happen with us….that is up to
        you. I just hope when you are ready, it is not too late for
        us. All I know is no matter where I go, or what I do in my
        life, I forever am changed by who you are and what you
        mean to me. I love you. I love you, I love you. You are
        beautiful just the way you are. Fate has a way of finding
        you, even when you don’t expect it.
