    <p class="dear"> Jay, </p>
    <p> When I walked into my brother's house tonight,
        I got the same response as usual. Everyone looked up
        from his or her drink, drum or guitar, smiled and threw a
        "what's up?!" my way. Everyone, that is, except you. I
        didnt notice it at first. However as the night wore on and
        you refused to make eye contact with me, I grew
        confused.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were a couple new people hanging out there,
        but there usually are. This new blonde chick; she
        seemed cool, but no one seemed to show an
        attachment to her, I wondered who she was there with.
        But when you jumped up to get another beer, she was
        standing by you and holding your hand. I figured you
        were the one she wanted to see. I quickly realized why
        you wouldnt look at me.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I'm not mad at you. So dont think that. I should be,
        though. Anyone else would. After all, you did highly warn
        me not to screw with your head, that you've been hurt
        alot and didnt want to be again. I said I wouldn't, and yet
        you were the one to play games with my mind and tease
        my heart by stringing me along and leading me to
        believe you liked me for two long months. I can't believe
        it took me that long to figure out you werent worth it. I
        can't believe you'd do that, especially me being "Nad's lil
        sis." I'm even more surprised my brother didnt beat you
        to a pulp, i guess you're lucky.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm over that. I'm so over that. You dont have to hide
        if you're seeing someone. I have a boyfriend. And he
        makes me so much more happier than you ever could
        have. I'm just glad I realized that, instead of letting you
        fool me.
        <br>
        <br>
        So next time, you can look at me. Next time, you can
        say hi or smile. You can also acknowledge your girl in
        front of me, I'm sure she'd appreciate it. And you can
        know I'm not mad. I'm much happier, actually.
        </p>
