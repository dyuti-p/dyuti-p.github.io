    <p class="dear"> Jeremy, </p>
    <p>     I just want you to know, I had a dream about
        you about a month or so ago. It was about us, sitting
        together on that porch swing on you balcony, watching
        the fireflies and talking. That was really it, nothing
        strange happened or anything, the dream itself was very
        simple, not much thought involved you know.
        <br>
        <br>
        The only strange thing about that dream is I haven't
        seen you in 11 months, and the whole time I was
        dreaming about you, I was lying next to Michael.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        You're probably going to think that I'm crazy, that is, if
        you don't already think I am, but after that night I
        couldn't stop thinking about you. Where have you been,
        what are you doing, do you still think about me, that kind
        of thing. At first I just figured it was natural, a girl stays
        with a guy for 2 years and she generally wonders what
        happened to him. I just don't think its that simple
        anymore though. Even when I'm with Michael I'm
        thinking about you. I keep having one thought come
        back to me, I tried to brush it off, but I guess I just can't.
        Am I still in love with you? 
        <br> 
        <br>
        Michael took me to the park for our 6 month
        anniversary last night, but all I could think about was
        you. Do you remember that June when you took me up
        to the goldfish pond at the park behind your house every
        day? And do you remember when you and I packed up
        the Bronco and just took off? I do. I remember every
        little detail, and what makes me feel worse is the fact
        that I miss it, and even worse, I miss you. Trust me, I've
        been trying to stop thinking about you, to drop the whole
        thing, to remember how much Mike means to me, how
        much he loves me, but my mind always wanders back
        to you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        The more I thought about you, the more I thought,
        why did we break up in the first place? I've been trying
        to figure that out, and all I can remember is that it was
        my fault. A lot of good that does me, huh. What ever it
        was had to have been pretty dumb on my part though; I
        really loved you. No offense to Michael, he has been so sweet and he tries so hard. But he is never going to be
        you.
        <br> 
        <br>
        So, I finally let the question stay in my mind. Am I still
in love with you?
        <br> 
        <br>
        Yes, I am.
