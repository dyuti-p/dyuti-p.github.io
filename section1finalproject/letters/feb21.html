    <p class="dear"> You, </p>
    <p>    It's on my mind every day.
        <br>
        <br>
        I listened to Johnny Cash sing his version of
        'hurt' this morning. I cried as I heard the
        words. Mine isn't so sad. I have had a good
        life. I have lived many roles in the same
        situations. I've had my share of hurt, I live in
        that 'empire of dirt' the song refers to and I'm
        happy.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Still, they do all go away in the end. Some,
        like you, I wish I could somehow hang onto,
        somehow keep. I remember what you've said.
        I remember how you gave so freely without
        asking anything in return. I remember how
        you tried to help me, mold me, direct me, give
        to me what you knew. I never got the chance,
        or maybe I just didnšt know the words or how
        to say exactly, "thank you". I don't know still
        how to say it so that you will really know how
        deep it goes, and already it comes too late.
        <br> 
        <br>
        You gave me what parents should have but
        didnšt or couldnšt. You taught me how to keep
        my life from becoming a tragedy. You gave
        me something beside my will to hold onto,
        then you disappeared.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you.
    </p>
