    <p class="dear"> Gwen </p>
    <p> I once filled out a survey that asked the
        ridiculous question of whether the surveyed has ever
        been in love. I answered, “yes, but not anymore.” I lied.
        It was a stupid question that couldn’t have had any other
        type of answer.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you first knocked on my back door, I thought I
        would surely hate you. You had disturbed my brooding,
        as you would do many times after that. I went along with
        you, and found out I would never harbor so much as an
        ill thought towards you. So things continued in this
        manner for some time. Those nights we spent watching
        stupid movies, or arguing about life, all those wonderful
        nights in the warm summer air have been burned into
        my memory forever. I have so many wonderful little
        images, all centered on you.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        What amazes me the most is how young we were
        then. Not that we’re too much older now. I think that 18
        is not much different than five. But back then I thought
        we were so old, and everything so big. And nothing
        amazes me more now, than the fact that I could have
        been that old and still acted so childish. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        It wasn’t that little note you gave me. It’s not the time
        you shared with me, all those nights for 2 years. What
        you gave me was far more precious than your time. In
        all the years I’ve known you, you have been the most
        loyal friend I never thought possible to have. You gave
        me the world, Gwen. You gave me your world, and
        everything in it. You freely gave me every shred of love
        and caring, all the honesty, your body and your soul
        carried.
        <br> 
        <br>
        And I threw it away. I left. I gave you up for some
        stupid dream I carried since before you ever came into
        my life. I traded all of the love you gave me, time and
        time again, because I thought there was something and
        someone better for me than you. That night I came
        home to find you asleep on the swing, it all started to hit
        me. Though I can’t tell you now, or ever, that’s when I
        realized I meant it. That day, when I left for what I
        thought was home, I told you I loved you. Carrying boxes to my car, watching you in my favorite hat, I had
        no idea why I was ever going away again. Why would I
        ever leave someone so beautiful, who surely loved me
        more than anyone ever will again? And I told you I loved
        you. I drove 1,400 miles that day and the next. Every
        mile I ticked off, I heard myself say, “I love you”, and
        realized that for the first and last time I’ll ever say those
        words, I meant them.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Critics will say that at 18, one can’t possibly know
        what love is. I know, damn the critics, that I will never
        love anyone as I love you now. You’ve been the only
        bright spot in my life, since I met you that day, 3 years
        ago. I also know now, that I lost you. No, I gave you
        away. I put aside the best thing in my life, because I
        thought there were better things in the world for me. I
        treated the treasure that you are like trash. And though
        I’ll regret nothing more than losing you, I know that I
        chose it. I hope that when you’re with him, you will be
        truly happy. He treats you better than I ever did, on my
        best day. I just want you to know, that the tables have
        turned. Though I can never have you back, I want it
        more than anything in this world. And one more thing, I
        lied: you were the only one.
