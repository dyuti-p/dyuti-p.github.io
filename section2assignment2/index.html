                        composed of people with many shades of skin
                        from very dark to relatively light. To the eyes
                        of an Indian viewer, this fact would prompt no
                        surprise but I think the artist was anticipating
                        the reactions of her Parisian colleagues as well."

                <div class="overlay">
                    <p>A woodcut printed in black ink on handmade Indian paper, Zarina's Dividing Line presents a thick, black, meandering line incising a pale-coloured surface into haphazard parts. This line is no ordinary line. It is contentious, elusive and dislocated, with no clear beginning or end. While it seems to originate somewhere out of frame, beyond the confines of its paper surface, any presumption of roots lying elsewhere remains speculative at best. Also speculative is the nature of this line's intent. Must it be, as its title suggests, a line dividing? Or, could it be, just as emphatically, a line reconciling?

As the great cliff looms in the approaching darkness, the base of the formation is already shadowed, while its upper reaches still catch some light of the fading day.

                  <p>Throughout this series, Pushpamala sheds a critical light on how nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century colonial powers used pseudoscience to control and create imagined distinctions, highlighting physical and cultural differences between western and Indigenous bodies and navigating prevalent power dynamics (Gund Gallery, 2012). By re-creating some of the images from this period, Pushpamala scrutinises and deconstructs the way that phrenology was used as a 'weapon' to construct racial hegemony in colonial ethnographic documentation.

One of the most important western symbols to be incorporated into Mughal portraits was the nimbus or sun halo around the emperor’s portrait. This symbol was ‘contrived from images of the Immaculate Conception by Albrecht Diirer in 1516, and would emphasise Jahangir’s special set-apart nature’ (Losty, in press).”
