      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        As a class, students will work together to design and build a Web Ring that links and loops between all students’ web publications (Section 1 Final Project). The Web Ring may be an external site of links (an index), but must also incorporate some form of modular code that is implemented on each student’s publication site.  <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Work together to build and design a modular code that links between all students' publications. Your design must accommodate all pre-existing web publication designs in a seamless and intuitive way, retroactively reassigning/discovering hierarchy of information (10 points) <br>
        Revisit your individual web publications to deploy the modular code as a feature update/patch (5 points)
