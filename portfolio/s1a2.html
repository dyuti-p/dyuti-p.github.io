A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        The class will work together to build an assemblage sculpture from found and classroom materials. Individual students will then create a “CSS Still Life” that must consider HTML layout, nesting, and CSS styling. Final work may employ CSS animations and any degree of design reduction and abstraction. All HTML & CSS drawings must be horizontally oriented at 800x600px. <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Work together to build an assemblage of symbolic materials (1 pt)
Discover and apply the basics of HTML and CSS languages as layout and styling tools (1 pt)
Utilize core design principles (such as framing, closed vs. open composition, overlap & continuity, directional movement, reduction, and abstraction) to creatively interpret a collective artwork (3-dimensional) as personal representation (2-dimensional) (5 pts)
Employ modes of creative problem solving, working within limitations (5 pts)
Clearly communicate your ideas, process, and execution in critique (5 pts)
Your CSS Still Life must be contained within an 800x600 px plane and demonstrate at least 1 instance of these criteria (1 pt each):
Divs
ID’s
Classes
Positioning (absolute, relative, fixed)
Padding
Margins
Background-color vs. Background-image vs. Background: linear-gradient
Pseudo-classes (before, after, hover, etc)
