      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        In small groups of 2 or 3, students will work together to establish a system that individual students will then utilize to recreate an image with Binary, ASCII, or Unicode characters. Groups may reconvene to reassess their group’s systems or individual students may “fork the code” (within reason) to better serve their images. Final text images must be a minimum of 60 character rows/columns along the shortest edge. <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Become familiar with a sandbox development environment
        Explore the foundation and utility of systems and languages
        In a group, develop an adequate system that can be used to clearly and/or creatively communicate your groups’ images (10 pts)
        Optimize your system for your individual image (10 pts)
        In critique, clearly discuss and communicate your developed system as related to your text drawing (5 pts)
        Start exploring inline styling and spans (Extra: +1-5 points)
