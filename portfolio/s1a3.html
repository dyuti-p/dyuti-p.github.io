      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        Students will create an online publication (fan site, zine, exhibition, etc) that includes 3-5 separate pages and a navigational tool/toolset. No single page and its linked content can be larger than 5 megabytes. <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Choose a topic for your publication, and establish a consistent visual style to deliver uniform messaging and theming (10 pts)<br>
  Interpret the webpage format to creatively present your topic's information to a viewer (10 pts)<br>
  What is the flow of information (steady or dynamic)? What is your navigation system between pages? Demonstrate intentional strategies to guide a viewer through your pages by exploring the principles of sequence: cadence, rhythm, pause, punctuation and irregularity, logical order (or intentional disorder), etc. (10 pts)<br>
  At least one page of your publication must utilize a grid: flexbox, floats, or tables (10 pts)<br>
  Organize your files and directories by instituting and delivering an effective, logical schema (5 pts)<br>
  Direct the class through your intended site navigation during critique (5 pts)
