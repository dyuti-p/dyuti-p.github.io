      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        Using p5.js, students will program a generative design that employs functions, loops, and conditionals. Designs must also incorporate an element of randomness or chance in their code. Students will work to embed this design within a separate website that also incorporates designed and user-interactive elements.   <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Get messy and have fun while exploring the creative potential within generative design tactics.<br>
  Incorporate conditional loops (for, if/else, while) with randomly defined parameters or arguments to produce a unique design each time a user loads the page. (15 points)<br>
  Seamlessly integrate at least one object or element that is changed or manipulated by user feedback (15 points).<br>
  Creatively combine your p5.js script with HTML and CSS to style, display, and permit further interactivity with pseudo-class selectors (:hover, :active, :focus, :target, :not(), :has(), etc). (10 points)<br>
  Be able to comfortably explain your concept, process, and code (line by line) in a critique setting. (10 pts)
