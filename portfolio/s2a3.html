      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        Computational science and, by proxy, web design have a unique history tethered to the users’ system clock. Students will follow a formalized process from brainstorming and sketching to prototyping and construction to create a browser-based design that employs the system clock’s 3 basic events (seconds, minutes, hours) using p5.js. Your “clock” doesn’t need to resemble a traditional clock, and may instead employ other functions that are triggered by these events.  <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Ideate and sketch out a minimum of 3 concepts that investigate the clock’s relationship to form and function. You will choose one of your sketches to prototype in p5.js. Upload images of all sketches to Canvas along with your clock URL. (10 pts)<br>
        Discover the basics of JavaScript syntax (and p5.js naming conventions) in order to realize your creative concept within your abilities. You may need to make concessions or revisit your initial idea in order to better suit your developing skill sets. What is gained or lost in the process of transforming your sketch into a prototype? Can ideas from other sketches be further explored to augment your creative interpretation of the clock’s form or function? (15 pts)<br>
        Your final p5.js clock must utilize 3 separate looping functions that relate to your user’s system clock’s 3 basic events (seconds, minutes, hours). (5 pts each, 15 pts)<br>
        Be able to comfortably explain your concept, process, and code (line by line) in a critique setting. (10 pts)
