      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications, tools, or services to safely “share” restricted data with other applications, tools, or services. The availability of this “public facing” data allows developers to build connected/supplementary platforms that may ease or augment a user’s experience. In teams of two (+), students will work together to create and execute an interactive design tool that employs API linking with IFTTT (If This Then That). Teams must also design and develop a website that serves to promote this tool and document its real-life application and usage.  <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        With your group, take time to research what applets are compatible with IFTTT. Ideate an assistive tool within these limitations to address a perceived problem (social, personal, political, etc). While researching, you may discover connections between apps/services that expand their capacities beyond familiar interactions. Explore the framework and restrictions of API linking (queries, data and terms, actions and triggers, etc) between apps/tools to creatively generate new connections and interactions. What can be gained by linking two unrelated tools? What is lost in the process? (2 pts)<br>
  Realize/develop your concept as an IFTTT recipe. (5 pts)<br>
  Design a single-page website that functions to “promote” your speculative design concept and assistive tool. Your sites must demonstrate consistent messaging and styling to assist in communicating the underlying ideas (thoughts, feelings, etc) behind your concept and recipe. Treat this space as a demonstration and documentation of your project, but also as an elevator pitch that can inspire and garner interest. How can you convince others to use this tool? (10 pts)<br>
  Since this is a collaborative design, students may choose to explore Figma as an assistive/collaborative front-end design and limited coding tool.<br>
  “Pitch your product” in a critique setting. (3 pts)
