A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        Individually or in small groups of 2 or 3, students will design and write a program or script to be performed. This can be taken literally, as in your script is intended to be enlivened by actors. This can be taken loosely and all terms can be creatively interpreted. Regardless, all performances must incorporate learned principles of scripted “functions,” and must also include an element of “chance.”  <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Plan — All scripts must include a written component. Will this be a literal script for actors? A set of instructions to be performed? A set of rules that can inform a dynamic experience? (5 pts)<br>
  Script — Your script must creatively interpret the logic of learned markup and programming languages, but does not need to be syntactically correct. (10 pts)<br>
  Execute — All performances must be able to be enacted for a minimum of 2 minutes (typically: 1 minute per page in a standard screenplay). If your duration exceeds 5 minutes, the entirety or continuation of your script must be adequately described or summarized. How will you critically and creatively engage your audience? (10 pts)<br>
  Document — You will create a website that appropriately documents your performance. (5 pts)
