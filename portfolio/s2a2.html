      <div class="banner-text">About me: Dev is a designer based in Philadelphia. A senior at the University of Pennsylvania, this portfolio website documents her Fall ’24 work in the course “DSGN 1020: Art of the Web.” Her thematic design interest lies in memory, affect, and sociopolitical issues. Postgrad, Dev aspires to work in the art world and advance accessibility in its markets. Outside of class, you can find her watching art history documentaries, spending hours at cafes after purchasing one cappuccino, and going on cat crawls in whatever city she finds herself in. </div>

    <h3>Assignment Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        OVERVIEW <br>
        Students will create a self-contained, single-page site that employs hover effects and CSS selectors to assist and encourage user interaction. Your site must include a minimum of 5 images (observing optimization and best practices) and all elements must contain adequate metadata/alt text. Your site must also account for viewport sizes to serve comparable or alternate user experiences.  <br>
        
        <br>
        GOALS <br> 
        Creatively utilize extended HTML and CSS options to account for users’ individual environments while mindfully serving appropriate content and styling. The full load of your page must be no larger than 1mb (5 pts).<br>
        All sites must demonstrate:<br>
        CSS Selectors to control separate elements or classes based on user feedback (:hover, :active, :focus, etc) (10 pts)<br>
        Viewport size accommodations by either solely using viewport ratio properties (for positioning, text size, etc) or serving entirely separate content to different users with @media rules (minimum of 3) (10 pts)<br>
        Alt text/title/metadata to offer fallback content options or alternative experiences (minimum of 5 images) (5 pts)
