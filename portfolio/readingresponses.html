      <h3>Week 2 - Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h3>
      <p>I have been thinking a lot about post recently (was very remorseful to learn that an international stamp costs $1.65), and it was fascinating to read Carrión's conceptualization of it. Mail art as a system controls the creation and circulation of work in a space outside of the government, hence collapsing that bureaucracy. With that collapse arrives a galvanized network which itself serves as art. This lead me to consider, what alternative spaces are there for artists to showcase their work outside the museum/gallery/biennial institution? Perhaps that is the "big monster." Additionally, what are the limits of Mail Art?

      <h3>Week 3 - Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h3>
      <p>Laurel Schwulst's words had me reflect on how I used to use the Internet more than decade ago. I used to visit Websites. Actual websites, not Instagram or another portal, but niche blog, story sites, gaming sites, Wikipedia, and even smaller social spaces such as DeviantArt and LiveJournal. Comparing that to my Internet use now, it is just that, corporational portals. Édouard U's advice to this problem was "Surf—don’t search—the web." His knowledge production method of co-reading is something I was funnily enough doing while reading his think piece (audiobook of To All the Boys I've Loved Before by Jenny Han). <br>

       <br> The metaphor of a" website as a puddle" resonated with me; not shallow persay, but depth or murkiness or temporality where it needs it. <br>
        
      <br>  What can mindful surfing look like now on an Internet dominated by enterprises? <br>
        
        <br>Beyond portfolios, what is an artist's responsibility on the Internet?</p>

      <h3>Week 4 - Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h3>
      <p>While reading Lialina's piece, I had questions brought up in relation to early web development. The author comments that one of the telling signs of a dead website is are missing image files. Who stores the associated folders that make up a website? Is it an individual or a larger server? It does not seem sustainable.
        <br>    
        <br>It is fascinating, the field of digital folklore, and the ways researchers have adapted anthropological methods into the digital space: " If we didn’t find anything, we tried to imagine what it might have looked like judging from the file names and surviving page elements.
        And sometimes, we just looked at the remains, like tourists in ancient Pompeii (Lialina 201)."

        <h3>Week 8 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h3>
        <p>Ludovico:

            <br> In the new proliferation of digital print, how can digital print mimic the dissemination and distribution reaches of palpable print? I found leaning into the opportunities presented by the hybridity of digital publishing and print (with present updates through QR codes for example) very fascinating. I think about the pros and cons of having paper in my hands versus viewing the same information through a digital channel (for example, how frustrating it is for me to be presented with a QR code of a menu versus an actual binded menu).
            <br>
            <br> Cramer:<br>
            
            I am curious about Carrión's abstraction of a book and how his theoretical work has influenced our understanding of digital publishing in this current century. Cramer's contribution to the discussion of post-digital print has me considering what the newer barriers to entry are in publishing? </p>

        <h3>Week 9 - Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h3>
        <p>In A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures, Ramsey Nasser highlights the challenges of creating a non-English programming experience. He discusses the shortcomings of One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) (a project aimed to empower children in all countries) where its programming languages are not based on its local languages. This is a large, unhighlighted, barrier for children who do not speak English yet want to explore their computers. Nasser reckons with the colonialism of programming by creating an Arabic programming language which exposes computer science’s linguistic biases (despite making an Arabic interface, English-based systems constrained its movements). Nasser concludes that localized programming languages are not the solution because "Recreating existing power structures with a different group on top is not an act of liberation."
<br> <br>
            What are the long-term consequences for non-English-speaking children who learn to program in their native language but eventually need to learn English for advanced work? Specifically, if they lack the resources and environment to learn a second-language, and then work in said second language. What does liberation look like in the backend of the digital space?</p>

        <h3>Week 10 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</h3>
        <p>…”surface itself is not neutral, despite appearances.” Duvall examines how the addition of the internet as a material for surface impacts the sign and the surface in its function of a sign. He goes on to explore how design has shifted throughout cultural movements. In modernism, design conventions called for a one-to-one relationship between signifier and the signified. This semiotic understanding can be found in modernist artworks as well and the development reminds me of Picassos’ Guitar 1912. Here, the guitar is made of cardboard parts that merely represent the corresponding part in the guitar. The signifier is turned inside out and becomes less about morphological representation and more about structural engagement.
<br> <br>
            Stunt typography replaces these conventions with postmodernism which embraces chaos, ambiguity, and messy visuals. This is a reaction and rejection of modernism and its ideals of signage. “The internet once referenced the signs of AFK (away from keyboard) life, but now AFK life references the web.” Of course, spheres of life cannot be compartmentalized but it is an important observation that comments on new norms of the digital age. Duvall offers the term hypermodernism to conceptualize the next, even current, evolution. Here, a sign has several referents. For example, Mickey Mouse’s ears can symbolize broader concepts such as capitalism and globalization.
            <br> <br>
            This has led me to wonder how a mass ubiquitous consumption of culture impacts our individual encounters with certain symbols and designs. I also wonder how design, primarily focused on commercial consumption, generates "original critical thought" today compared to how it did in the past.</p>

        <h3>Week 12 - Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h3>
        <p>Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel's String Games by Dot Tuer, offers new thinkings about the subject of memory, its negotiation and the capturing of memory within a digital realm. String Games offers a sense of play, interactivity, and network in a new media framework. Cat's cradle is a game I grew up playing during recess and it is fascinating how inserting “number, a letter, a word, a name, a sentence, a fragment of a poem, a visual image, a gesture and a sound for fingers “ transforms this children's game into an understanding of absence and presence. I wish Tuer defined the concept of the poetics of absence more precisely through this chapter.

        <h3>Week 13 - Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h3>
        <p>Soulellis examines publishing through various gestures. He describes traditional publishing to be built on interruption and a fixed container. Interruption, Soulellis says, does not always have to be radical but needs to demand attention. It made me laugh how the author describes live streaming as noise versus publishing. And it's true, there is no story developing within these type of broadcasts. "[I]t’s simply a constant becoming." Livestreams are politicized spaces and it reminds me of Shia LaBeouf's project He Will Not Divide UsLinks to an external site. at the Museum of the Moving Image. 
            <br> <br>
            Publishing commands attention. Feeds trap us in semi-awareness. The reading really highlighted to me how, for example, how on a bulletin board I am exclusively interacting with human voices. On my Instagram feed, it is a cacophony of recommendations, advertisements, and finally, the users I follow. 
            <br> <br>
            1. What does authorship look like within the new paradigm?
            2. If feeds are equated to publishing, who are the publishing agents of the net?</p>

        <h3>Week 15 - Boris Groys - Art on the Internet.pdf</h3>
        <p>In regards to spaces of self-dissimulation, I would disagree with Groys in including the museum in the list. Groys describes the Internet as a wall-less space, where military planning and literature exists on the same level, the same platform. I found this lack of compartmentalization of the Internet fascinating. The contrast of art and art documentation was very insightful as well. In what ways does the nonfictional character of documentation interrupt the fictional nature of the work? What exactly is self-globalization? Is there any for localization on the Internet or is it an immediate jump to the global? What is the impact of emphasizing decontextualization in the broader historical canon?</p>
